# üêù Use API 

Camomilla comes with many api endpoint builded with Django Rest Framework. 

To use the endpoints you need to add the handler to the project urls.py

```python
# <project_name>/urls.py
urlpatterns += path('api/camomilla/', include('camomilla.urls'))
```

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware!
Remember that if you use camomilla pages `dynamic_pages_urls` handler should always be the last handler of your urlpatterns list.

By default every endpoint comes with a full CRUD in the style of django rest framework with some mode feature beaked in.
