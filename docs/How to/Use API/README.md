# üêù Use API 

Camomilla comes with many api endpoint builded with Django Rest Framework. 

To use the endpoints you need to add the handler to the project urls.py

```python
# <project_name>/urls.py
urlpatterns += path('api/camomilla/', include('camomilla.urls'))
```

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware!
Remember that if you use camomilla pages `dynamic_pages_urls` handler should always be the last handler of your urlpatterns list.
:::


By default every endpoint comes with a full CRUD in the style of django rest framework with some mode feature beaked in.


## üóÇÔ∏è List endpoint

__URL Structure:__
 - `api/camomilla/<model_name>`

__Simple Response:__
```json
[
    { ... single model data ... }, {}, {}
]
```

### Use Pagination

List api comes with a builtin paginator.
The paginated response is disabled by defualt to be compliant with default rest framework lists. 
If you want a paginated response you need to specify the page size in the request as a GET parameter.

For example, the request `/api/camomilla/<model_name>?items=10`, will return data splittet 10 elements per page.

__Paginated Response:__
```json
{
    "items": [
        { ... single model data ... }, {}, {}
    ],
    "paginator": {
        "count": 1, // number of elements
        "page": 1, // current page number
        "has_next": false, // has a next page
        "has_previous": false, // has a previous page
        "pages": 1, // total number of pages
        "page_size": 10 // number of elements per page (depends on items parameter)
    }
}
```

### Use Filtering
List api comes with a builtin filter syntax.
You can filter data with GET query parameters using the following sintax:

```/api/camomilla/<model_name>?fltr=field_name=value```

This syntax can be repeated multiple times.

```/api/camomilla/<model_name>?fltr=field_name=value&fltr=field_name=value```

In place of `field_name` you can use any [django filter argument](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/db/queries/#retrieving-specific-objects-with-filters).  

If the value has commas like `val1,val2,val3` it will be treated as an array.
For example you can filter some model like this:

```/api/camomilla/<model_name>?fltr=field_name__in=val1,val2```

### Use Search

You can also full text search your model with query param `search`:

```/api/camomilla/<model_name>?search=q_string```
