### Your first code contribution
If you want to contribute to Camomilla by writing code, you can start by looking at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lotrekagency/camomilla/issues). There you can find issues that are marked as "good first issue" and are suitable for new contributors. If you want to work on an issue, please leave a comment on it so that we can assign it to you. If you want to work on something else, please open an issue first so that we can discuss it. This way we can avoid duplicated work and make sure that your contribution will be accepted. Once you have finished your work, you can open a pull request. We will review it and, if everything is fine, we will merge it. If you are not sure about something, feel free to open a pull request as soon as possible so that we can discuss it. We are always happy to help!

### Coding conventions
We try to follow the [Django coding style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/). Please make sure to follow it when writing code for Camomilla. If you are not sure about something, feel free to ask us.
